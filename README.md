# SwiftUI-app-for-iOS-15-Part-1-2-3-

Hi All👋🏻

Part1
I signed up for courses on SwiftUI created by cool designer Meng To 🙌
So far I haven't learned much, but I want to note his work on a custom TabBar based on Spacer(), it's a very simple and convenient mechanic ⚙️
I learned how to export SVG to SwiftUI and animate 🎬
I also liked working with GeometryReader, thanks to which TabBar was made for each screen width 🖥
By the way really admire SF Symbols 3, which allows you to customize the set of colors for each symbol 🍎

Good luck ✨

Part2
Today I wanted to share that I completed the second part of Meng To's course on SwiftUI ✍️
I did a lot of work with the MatchedGeometryEffect, thanks to which I made cool transitions between View 🌸
I also learned how to use GeometryReader to create cool parallax effects or scroll position when scrolling ScrollVIew ⚙️
I created a cool style via extension that allows to animate text size and other things without bugs by creating my own modifiers 🐼
Also thanks to the EnvironmentObject I was able to pass data to all Views through which I could close and open the TabBar or hide or reveal the StatusBar⚡️
There will be many new things ahead, like Log In Сard, etc ☄️
